## Installation

### Dependencies

`instally` checks for and installs its own dependencies if they're missing upon
initial run:

* [`curl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) - For installing `gum` and as a
  fallback installation method.
* [`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) - For interactivity.
* [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) - For reading your `packages.json` file
  and installing packages.

## Usage

1. Specify the packages you'd like to be installed in `packages.json`.
2. Run `instally`. `instally` will read `packages.json` and provide an
   interactive CLI for package selection and installation.

Now you can take your custom `packages.json` file anywhere with `instally`, and
install your favorite packages on (almost) anything!
